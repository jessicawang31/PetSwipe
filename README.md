## Problem Statment 
Despite the growing number of pets in need of adoption, many remain in shelters due to the lack of accessibility and outreach, resulting in millions euthanized each year. Potential pet adopters travel long distances to even find a pet that matches their lifestyle and preferences. Existing adoption platforms lack the convenience of an user friendly mobile design, making it difficult to discover your ideal companion.

With PetSwipe, adoption can be reimagined with a swipe-based mobile interface. By allowing users to "match" with pets by swiping left (no) or right (yes) and filter based on preferences and location. We help make this adoption process more accessible and effective, providing a more consolidated and engaging platform.
